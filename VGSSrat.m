% this enzyme shows negative cooperativity in the binding of
% glutamyl-cysteine, in that binding of the first substrate (k2) reduces enzyme
% affinity for the second substrate (k3) by a factor of alpha, which was
% calculated to be 2.6. The adair equation can be broken down into what
% resembles a two substrate M-M equation (1 substrate concentration but 2
% Kms), so I added in the "third" substrate, glycine, to make the equation
% work for three variables
